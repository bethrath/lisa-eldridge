		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<span class="bio"><p>Lisa Eldridge is one of the most experienced and respected makeup artists on the international fashion and beauty circuits. Whether she’s called upon to create her signature look, best described as fresh and flawless, or to work her makeup magic for the catwalk or editorial shoots, her modern approach to beauty has made her indispensable to designers, editors, photographers, art directors and celebrities alike. </p>
		<p>Having previously lived and worked in Paris, New York and LA, Lisa is now based in London and works regularly with many of the world’s top fashion photographers including Mert & Marcus, Sølve Sunsbø, Patrick Demarchelier and David Sims, while her masterful makeup artistry has appeared on the pages of virtually every fashion magazine, including international publications such as VOGUE, ELLE, ALLURE, HARPER’S BAZAAR and LOVE.</p>
		<p>The list of celebrities Lisa has made up reads like a who’s who of the world’s most glamorous stars, including Kate Winslet, Keira Knightley, Lily Collins, Kate Moss, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Emma Watson. Lisa has also collaborated with countless top fashion houses on their advertising campaigns and fashion shows, including Gucci, Chloé, Alberta Ferretti, Prada, Jil Sander, Donna Karan, Moschino and PPQ.</p>
		<p>Having previously held creative directorships, ambassadorial and developmental roles for leading brands including Chanel, Shiseido and Boots No7, Lisa is currently global creative director of Lancôme, working across product development, advertising campaigns and digital strategy.</p>
		<p>In October 2015, Lisa published her first book, Face Paint: The Story of Makeup, an accumulation of years of research into the history of makeup. The book quickly became a New York Times bestseller.</p>
		<p>The first professional makeup artist with her own dot com, since the launch of Lisa’s award-winning website she has developed a large, global online following, while maintaining a high editorial profile. Continually quoted on the pages of the glossiest magazines, Lisa’s expertise has become highly prized, and she is now one of the most recognised faces in the beauty industry both in the UK and internationally. </p></span>
